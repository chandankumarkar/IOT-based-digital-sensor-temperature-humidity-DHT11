IOT based digital sensor ( temperature , humidity)  DHT11IOT
Objective
To interface a digital sensor with an IoT board and acquire real-time environmental data (temperature & humidity).
Aim
To read temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor using Arduino UNO and display the readings on the Serial Monitor. Also, control an LED based on temperature (hardware output).
Components Used
1.	Arduino UNO (or NodeMCU can also be used, but UNO is simplest)
2.	DHT11 Sensor (Digital Temperature & Humidity)
3.	LED (any color)
4.	220Ω resistor (for LED)
5.	Breadboard
6.	Jumper wires
7.	USB cable (for Arduino + Serial Monitor)
